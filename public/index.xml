      <description>In shadows&amp;rsquo; grasp, where sunlight seldom gleams,
Two silent foes arise, as in a dream.
Depression, heavy anchor of the soul,
Anxiety, a tempest taking toll.
Depression, like a weight upon the chest,
A cloak of darkness, robbing all that&amp;rsquo;s best.
It whispers lies, of hope forever lost,
As joy and peace it tirelessly exhausts.
Anxiety, a ceaseless, racing mind,
A storm that&amp;rsquo;s hard to leave, impossible to bind.
It paints the future in uncertain hues,</description>

      <description>‚ù£Ô∏è
In Shadows Cast, She holds her breath,
Bound to love, She fights with death.
In doubts, she dances, lost in fear,
Unsure if his love&amp;rsquo;s truly near.
üñ§
With every touch, she seeks a sign,
In whispered words, a tangled line.
Does he love her? She can&amp;rsquo;t decode,
In toxic webs, their hearts erode.
üò∞
Yet still she stays, in hope&amp;rsquo;s embrace,
Caught in love&amp;rsquo;s elusive chase.
In shadows deep, her heart entwined,</description>

      <description>Made the wrong choice, Hell is the repitition,
Hoping for new scenes, but I see same sights.
Unchanging landscape, never the surprise,
Always the same, but never quite right

      <description>While you claim to care,
When I bring my issues to you,
I feel like they‚Äôre being belittled as minor concerns.
Even though you say to ‚Äúignore it,‚Äù
I‚Äôm left with a hurt heart‚Ä¶

      <description>In the mirror‚Äôs gaze, find strength untold,
Embrace the flaws, let self-love unfold.
A dance with echoes of kindness within,
Cherish the soul, let self-love begin.
Through trials and triumphs, be your guide,
In the heart‚Äôs cathedral, let love reside.
Each flaw a note in the melody of you,
Compose a symphony, authentic and true.
Like petals unfolding in morning light,
Discover self-love, a radiant sight.
No need for judgment, let acceptance bloom,</description>

      <title>I CAN&#39;T BREATHE - A Poem</title>

      <description>In shadows cast by prejudice, a tale unfolds,
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe,‚Äù the whispered plea, truth be told.
A world divided by the hues we wear,
Yet, in unity, a remedy lies somewhere.
Echoes of injustice linger in the air,
As wounds of hatred fester, deep and bare.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe,‚Äù a refrain of human pain,
Yearning for a day when love shall reign.
Skin is but a canvas, painted diverse,</description>

      <description>Welcome to my corner of creativity! I&amp;rsquo;m a 14 year old writer, poet, and songwriter. Since I could hold a pencil, I&amp;rsquo;ve been captivated by the power of words and melodies that weave through life.
As a writer, I delve into realms both real and imaginary, crafting stories that transport readers to new worlds and evoke emotions that linger long after the last page. Poetry, for me, is the language of the soul, a canvas where I paint emotions with the strokes of verse, exploring the beauty and complexity of the human experience.</description>
