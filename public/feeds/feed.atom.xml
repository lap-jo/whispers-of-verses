I think of death so much,
It feels just like a memory,
A somber melody that plays,
In the depths of my reverie.
It whispers of endings and goodbyes,
Of dreams unfulfilled and tears untold,
A silent ache that lingers on,
In the echoes of stories left cold.
Yet within this melancholy symphony,
A bittersweet truth softly lies,
That even in death&rsquo;s relentless grip,
Love&rsquo;s light fades, and sorrow sighs.]]></summary>

I keep consuming
Your toxic allure
In your smoke
I cannot be free
Each drag I take
A fleeting pleasure
Yet deeper into darkness
I descend
Your burning touch
A dangerous treasure
Leaving scars
That never truly mend
Like wisps of smoke
You drift away
Leaving aches of longing in your wake
I chase your ghost
Day after day
Knowing the toll
Knowing the ache]]></summary>

Silent echoes of a world

Parents counting grades

Eyes on papers
numbers and scores

A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s
a relentless demand
Ignoring the plea

Dreams and hopes
weighed down by the scale
In the pursuit of a polished tale

In a world where emptiness fought.

But in the willingness to feel, to rise after a fall.
They carry burdens heavy, hidden beneath their guise,
Yet within their hearts, the truth never truly dies.
For tears are not a weakness, but a testament to grace,]]></summary>
