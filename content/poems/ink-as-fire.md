I dream in revolutions 

Words igniting veiled minds 

Paper becomes rebellion 

Sentences fracture the ordinary 
___

Each stroke a blade 

splitting ignorance from bone 

perspective bleeds 

shattering walls into prisms

___

Through ink 

I unravel silence

Lay bare the marrow of humanity 

My pages burn 

And from the ashes

Awakening 

___
