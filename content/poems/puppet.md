i wake up


in a body


that is not mine


who tied these strings


to my bones


and made me dance

\---

there are eyes


i cannot see


but they see me


they weigh me down


with their silence


with their judgment

\---

the mirror whispers


you are not enough


not the face


not the heart


not the soul


it spits back


what i already know

\---

how do you live


when your shadow


feels like a stranger


when the voice in your head


is your worst enemy

\---

they tell me


to love myself


but how can i


when my reflection


is a war zone


when every piece of me


is a battle lost

\---



the walls are closing in


the masks are smiling


the strings are pulling


and i am breaking

\---

but no one notices


because my cracks


are silent

\---
