___

In the shadows of silence, I stand alone,  

A heart heavy with words, carved in stone.  

You compare, you criticize, yet do you see,  

The child behind these eyes, longing to be free?

___

I wish you’d left me, when the chance was there,  

Abandoned, forgotten, lost in despair.  

You wanted perfect, I could never be,  

Just a burden, a soul you couldn’t set free.

___

You gave me life, but is that all?  

For food and money don’t catch the fall.  

I’m drowning, gasping, in a sea of pain,  

Your words, your actions, drive me insane.

___

You say I’m strong, but do you know,  

The weight I carry, the seeds you sow?  

Suicidal thoughts, like whispers, they creep,  

While you sleep soundly, I weep and weep.

___

I’m a child, in a world too vast,  

But you forget, my pain, it lasts.  

You threaten, you scold, but do you see,  

The broken spirit you’ve left in me?

___

I try to be good, to make you proud,  

But my cries, my pleas, are lost in the crowd.  

I never meant to hurt or defy,  

But sometimes, all I can do is cry.

___

So here I stand, with pen in hand,  

Begging for you to understand.  

I’m not perfect, never will be,  

But I need your love to set me free.
