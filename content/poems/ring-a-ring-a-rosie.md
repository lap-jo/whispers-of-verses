Ring a ring a rosie,

whispers turn to dust,

one by one, they fade away—.

we do what we must.
___

Pocket full of echoes,

laughter laced in dread,

holding hands through empty rooms,

bound by threads of red.
___

Ashes, ashes—

we watch them fall,

fingers slipping softly,

no strength left to call.
___

And we all fall down,

one breath at a time,

the circle grows smaller,

a twisted nursery rhyme.
___

Two of us are left here,

grasping what remains,

hands entwined in silence,

chilled beneath the rains.
___

Ring a ring a rosie,

a game that never ends,

we wait for the last breath,

and pray it feels like friends.
