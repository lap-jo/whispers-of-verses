It felt like I was drowning,

Choking on water as it slowly filled my lungs.

The current pulled harder, coldness numbing my skin,

While fish brushed against my leg,

Welcoming me into their silent, dark home.
____

Their touch was soft, yet the weight of the depths
 dragged me down,

Eyes closing, I tried to call for help,

But my voice was swallowed by waves,

Lost in a vast, echoing sound.
____


Just as I thought I was about to die, I realized—

I wasn't drowning.

I was merely thinking of drowning,

Contemplating the quiet surrender.
____

The weight wasn’t water, but the heaviness of my own mind,

A turbulent sea of thoughts pulling me under, breath by breath.

The fish were the whispers in my head,

Guiding me deeper into the abyss I’d crafted.
_____

Suffocation came from the weight of my actions,

Choices like stones, dragging me from the light.

Closing my eyes mirrored every time I gave up,

I almost drowned,

And every time I’m left alone,

I drown.
