You entered my life like the swell of an overture 

A dancer stepping into the light 

bearing the weight of a thousand unspoken things

Your plié was not just a bend 

It was the earth itself lowering for you

each tendu traced longing into the air 

and grief, with its quiet hands 

pulled the strings of your arabesque.

I tried to follow you into the dance 

but your pirouette was the moon spinning away

always one heartbeat beyond reach 

You leapt---a grand jeté that tore the sky

and I, rooted in the shadows of the wings 

felt my chest crack open like the stage beneath you.

Love with you is a pas de deux of contradictions 

I am both your anchor and your flight 

the arms that lift you toward the heavens 

and the weight that keeps you bound to the earth.

___

When we move together 

grief and joy intertwine like ribbons 

threading the silence between us 

___

In adagio, you linger 

each movement a whisper of what we've lost 

But in allegro, your laughter breaks like glass

a wild rhythm that cuts and heals in the same beat 

You spin happiness into gold 

only for it to dissolve into the dark 

___
When the curtain falls,

I am left holding the ghost of your last step 

a memory so fragile 

it shatters beneath my breath.

But even in your absence, the music plays on.

I feel you in the shadows of the barre 

in the soft echo of pointe shoes tapping time.
___

And when I close my eyes 

you are there again, dancing---

as pas de chat through my heart.

Your love is an endless ballet 

its beauty breaks me 

its sorrow lifts me 

and I would follow you across every stage 

even into forever
