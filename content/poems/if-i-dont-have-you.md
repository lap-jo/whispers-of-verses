I could hold the stars in my hands,

Count the riches buried in the sand,

Wear the finest silks and gold,

But none of it would make me whole.
_____

They could crown me queen, a thousand times,

Sing my name in songs and rhymes,

But all the praise would feel so small,

If your love wasn’t there at all.
____

The world could be mine, so they say,

But without you, it’s just another day,

No diamonds shine, no light breaks through,

For what’s the world if I don’t have you?
