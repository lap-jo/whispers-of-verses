___

In shadows cast by judgement's cold

embrace,

A survivor's tale, a heart in shattered grace.

Through trauma's grip, she walks a crushing

load.

___

In the courtroom's echo, justice remains

blind,

Her voice unheard, lost in the legal grind.

Yet, she persists, through the darkened

night,

A silent struggle, a resilient fight.

___

Society's whispers, a cruel, accusing tone,

Blaming attire, as if guilt can be known.

Yet strength emerges from the depths

within,

Resilience as her shield, against the world's

din.

___

Freedom for the offender, a haunting

scene,

She bears the scars, unseen, yet keen.

Empathy, a balm, often in short supply,

Yet hope flickers in her steadfast, tearful

eye.

___

Let compassion be a beacon in the night,

To heal the wounds, restore her stolen

light.

For in unity, we can change the script,

Break the silence, let empathy uplift.

___
