They say you’re the problem,

But do they really see?

The battles that rage inside,

The weight you carry silently.
____

Do they know the things you face,

The disgust that won’t let go?

You try so hard to push it down,

But it’s all you’ve come to know.
___

“You’re a failure,” says the voice,

It echoes every night,

Relentless in its cruelty,

Until it steals your light.
___

You promise you’ll do better,

But each time you start to fall,

The voice is there to catch you,

Reminding you of it all.
___

“End it now,” it whispers,

A burden too heavy to share,

But no one feels what you feel,

No one’s really there.
___

Even those who say they love you,

Can’t grasp the pain you hide,

So you search for comfort anywhere,

But it’s empty, cold inside.
___

The demon tells you lies,

Drives you to the edge,

And when they finally notice,

They don’t understand the wedge.
___

They’ll never truly know

The wars you fight within,

The scars that don’t show on your skin,

Where does healing begin?
