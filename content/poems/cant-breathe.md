*In shadows cast by prejudice, a tale unfolds,*

*“I can’t breathe,” the whispered plea, truth be told.*

*A world divided by the hues we wear,*

*Yet, in unity, a remedy lies somewhere.*

*Echoes of injustice linger in the air,*

*As wounds of hatred fester, deep and bare.*

*“I can’t breathe,” a refrain of human pain,*

*Yearning for a day when love shall reign.*

*Skin is but a canvas, painted diverse,*

*Yet unity remains the universe.*

*“I can’t breathe,” a call to break the chain,*

*To embrace compassion, let understanding reign.*

*In each heart’s rhythm, a shared beat,*

*“I can’t breathe,” a cry for mercy sweet.*

*Together we must rise, a chorus strong,*

*For in unity, we find where we belong.*
