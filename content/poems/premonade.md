ðŸ˜°

I think of death so much,

It feels just like a memory,

A somber melody that plays,

In the depths of my reverie.

___

It whispers of endings and goodbyes,

Of dreams unfulfilled and tears untold,

A silent ache that lingers on,

In the echoes of stories left cold.

___

Yet within this melancholy symphony,

A bittersweet truth softly lies,

That even in death's relentless grip,

Love's light fades, and sorrow sighs.

### a little footnote

*poem title inspired by the charles bukowski one. Agum probably doesn't know who
that is lol. I'm forced to title these some of myself as she claims she's too 
busy actually writing poetry to worry about titles.*

*Last time you'll here from me. This is probably bad for SEO lol.*

*leave comments below don't worry if you get no response immediately she will 
mostly be replying on weekends only as she has school. If you leave your email
below when commenting you will receive the response notification.*
