___

In a world of colors, unique and bright,

Autism's prism casts its radiant light.

Each soul, a puzzle, a complex design,

A tapestry woven, one of a kind.

___

In the realm of patterns, they find their way,

Infinite shades of night and day.

Their minds, a canvas of endless art,

A masterpiece, waiting to impart.

___

Through different eyes, they view our sphere,

A perspective profound, crystal clear.

In the symphony of senses, they find their song,

A harmonious rhythm, where they belong.

___

Communication, a bridge they build,

In silence and words, their hearts fulfilled.

For in their world, they teach us to see,

The beauty in difference, in diversity.

___

With patience and love, we all can learn,

To cherish each color, to discern,

That in this spectrum, we all play a part,

In the poetry of autism, a work of the heart.
