This year, I spilled myself.

Not neatly, not in careful drops,

But in floods—

a rush of **everything** I thought I was,

everything I wasn’t ready to see.

It started hectic,

a blur of alarms and laughter too loud to mean anything.

Fake friends wore the kind of smiles

that leave teeth marks in your back,

but I smiled back,

because sometimes pretending is survival.

I learned about family—

the ones who stayed silent,

the ones who whispered truths

like weapons I didn’t know they carried.

Blood doesn’t always bond;

sometimes, it bleeds.

I shattered once.

Not the beautiful kind of breaking—

No, I was a mess on the floor,

shaking hands, gasping for air,

wondering if this is what it feels like

to lose yourself completely.

But somewhere in that wreckage,

I think I found God.

Not in stained glass or sermons,

but in the quiet spaces

where nothing else could reach me.

And music—

oh, music saved me.

I found new sounds that felt like prayers,

like someone had written them

just to pull me out of myself.

The world outside was chaos too.

Fires swallowed forests whole,

wars whispered and screamed,

and we all wore masks—

some to survive,

some because the truth was too ugly to bear.

But even in the storm,

I grew.

I found purpose,

the kind that digs its roots into your chest

and won’t let you look away.

I found people who saw me,

who stayed,

who didn’t flinch when I told them my truths.

This year didn’t hold my hand.

It dragged me, kicking and crying.

But somewhere along the way,

I stood up.

I stood tall.

And when the year finally exhaled,

its last gasp of heavy, broken air,

I whispered back—

**At least we tried.**
