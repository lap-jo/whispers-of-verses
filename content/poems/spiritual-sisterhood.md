___

I don't call you my sister for our shared blood's flow,

But for the understanding that between us does grow.

In the silent whispers and the unspoken bond,

In the depths of empathy, our connection is fond.

___

Through trials and triumphs, hand in hand we stride,

In the moments of darkness, you're my beacon, my guide.

With a glance, you decipher the words left unsaid,

In your presence, I find solace, where my soul is fed.

___


Though not born of the same womb, our hearts beat as one,

In this journey called life, side by side, we've spun.

So, I don't call you my sister for mere biology's decree,

But for the kinship of spirit, that sets you apart for me.
