*In meadows green, where wildflowers*
*dance,*

*Beneath the sun's warm, golden glance,*

*The whispering trees, their leaves a flutter,*

*Tell tales of time, in every flutter.*

___

*The babbling brook, with it's gentle song,*

*Winds it's way, serene and strong,*

*Through valleys deep and mountains high,*

*Nature's symphon, reaching the sky.*

___

*On wings of birds, in graceful flight,*

*Painting the heavens with colors bright,*

*The harmony of earth and sky,*

*In every creature, life does lie.*

___

*From dawn's first light to dusk's last sigh,*

*Nature's beauty never does die,*

*In every leaf, in every breeze,*

*Her eternal spirit, forever frees.*
