Trust me, they say,

But do they know what trust is?

A river once clear,

Now poisoned by stones they’ve dismissed.

_____
I poured my heart,

Ink spilled on pages blank—

But each word was met with silence,

A void where echoes sank.

_____

Trust was a seed,

Sown in a hopeful bed,

But it withered in the shadows,

Left to starve, unled.
______

You wore my trust like a cloak,

Warmed by my belief—


Then abandoned it in the cold,

Torn, frayed, beyond relief.

______
Now trust is a flame,

Once steady, now a flicker—

A spark that shivers in the wind,

But can’t remember what it’s after.

______
Do they know what trust is?

I thought I held the key—

But now it’s just a rusted lock,


A door that won’t set me free.
