I was your secret, your stolen glance,  

A name whispered between lessons,  

Where innocence danced on the edge,  

Of promises unspoken, yet heavy.

___

You praised me, your favorite pupil,  

Told me I was special, different,  

I believed in every word, every smile,  

Craving the attention you fed me.

___

But behind those locked doors,  

Where shadows knew no bounds,  

You stripped me of my youth,  

Wrote lies across my skin.

___

You wore a ring I didn’t see,  

A life I wasn’t part of,  

Children who called you father,  

While I called you mine in the dark.

___

You used me like an eraser,  
 
To clean the mistakes you’d made,  

But left me worn down, hollow,  

A ghost in a classroom of memories.

___

Now I sit at the back, silent,  

Watching you with different eyes,  

No longer the teacher’s pet,  

Just another lesson learned.
