You might think it's one of those

I love my parents poems,

Or I adore them so much, right?

Well, not everyone has a happy ending.
_______

They gave me life, but did they give me love?

A roof, yes—but did it shelter my soul?

They taught me lessons, but were they the right ones?

How do you thank them when you’re left in pieces?
____

I wasn’t always their pride and joy,

I was the silence between their screams.

A child in a home that felt like a ghost,

Haunted by promises that never came.
______

You see, love doesn’t always heal,

And apologies, though many, don’t undo the years.

Not every bond is meant to be whole—

Some break, some burn, some disappear.
_____

You might think it’s one of those

I forgive my parents poems,

But some scars are meant to stay.

And not every story has a happy ending.
