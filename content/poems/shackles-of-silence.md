Raised to be humble, quiet, and small,

Taught to be strong, never to fall.  

To serve and to please, to never defy,  

To wield iron fists, to never cry.

___

Her worth is in grace, her voice but a whisper,  

His power in rage, emotions a fissure.  

Love is obedience, love is pain,  

Love is possession, a storm to sustain.

___

Endure the beating, for he loves her still,  

Dominate, dictate, bend her to will.  

Her body a vessel, her spirit in chains,  

A stoic protector, a beast that remains.

___

Yet in the quiet, a spark does ignite,  

In silence, a tremor, a flicker of light.  

She questions the chains, the roles she must play,  

He questions the fury, the mask every day.

___

A whisper of freedom, a longing for peace,  

A voice that says kindness can bring release.  

Yearning for dawn, to break from the gray,  

Yearning for love, in a fairer way.

___

Raised to be humble, taught to be strong,  

In shadows they linger, for far too long.  

Yet in their hearts, a shared desire,  

To break free together, and rise from the fire.
