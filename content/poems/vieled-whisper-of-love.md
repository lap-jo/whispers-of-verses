*In Shadows Cast, She holds her breath,*

*Bound to love, She fights with death.*

*In doubts, she dances, lost in fear,*

*Unsure if his love's truly near.*
____________

🖤

*With every touch, she seeks a sign,*

*In whispered words, a tangled line.*

*Does he love her? She can't decode,*

*In toxic webs, their hearts erode.*
____________

*Yet still she stays, in hope's embrace,*

*Caught in love's elusive chase.*

*In shadows deep, her heart entwined,*

*A fragile soul, in love confined.*
