___

*They told me it was just one drink,*  

*But that drink took another drink, and soon*  

*I became the drink, swirling and deep,*  

*Lost in its amber allure, a silent swoon.*

___

*One sip, a bridge to fleeting connection,*  

*But the drink craved more, a deeper affection,*  

*A surrogate for the warmth I sought,*  

*In a world where emptiness fought.*

___

*Each sip, a whisper, a fleeting escape,*  

*From the ache of a world too sharp, too bright.*  

*I danced with shadows in the night’s embrace,*  

*A fragile flame flickering, fighting the fight.*

___

*Days turned to nights, nights into haze,*  

*Caught in a cycle, a relentless chase.*  

*Where the bottle promised solace, a maze*  

*Of false comfort, a numbing embrace.*

___

*Until one day, amid shattered dreams,*  

*I woke to find the mirror’s harsh gleam.*  

*A stranger gazing back, hollow and stark,*  

*In the depths of the bottle, lost in the dark.*

___

*They told me it was just one drink,*  

*But that drink took another drink, and soon*  

*I became the drink, a soul adrift,*  

*Until I chose to break free, to reclaim the noon.*
