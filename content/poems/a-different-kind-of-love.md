I did not find you in the way 

they find each other 

with their shallow hands 

and hurried hearts 

I found you 

like a lost language 

buried in the earth 

every word unfamiliar 

yet known to me in some

ancient part of my being.
___

They only know the fire 

that devours.

But in you 

I found the heat that lingers 

after the embers die 

the warmth that keeps 

a body alive 

through the coldest nights 
___

Lust looks and leaves 

But you-

You stayed 

not as a possession 

but as a presence 

craving yourself into the walls 

of my existence.
___

Even if the gods forgot our names 

and the oceans swallowed

all the earth 

I would still know you-

your soul would echo 

through the hollow of mine 

a sound eternal 

a love beyond 

the frailty of flesh
