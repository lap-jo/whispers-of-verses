___

In the mirror's cold embrace, a stranger's

gaze,

Eyes once known, now lost in haze.

Sculpted cheek and altered smile,

A face remade, yet not worthwhile.

___

Under the knife, dreams took shape, 

Chasing beauty a grand escape.

Each cut, a promise to be reborn,

But identity, tattered and torn.

___

In pursuit of perfection's gleam,

She forgot the self that used to dream.

Layers deep, the person hides

Behind facades where truth subsides.

___

The mirror speaks of flawless skin,

Yet echoes only emptiness within.

Each change a step further astray,

From the soul that knew its way.

___

Who am I? The question burns,

Amidst the beauty, a heart yearns.

For in the quest to be remade,

The essence of the self has frayed.

___

Lost in reflections, seeking signs,

In altered form, the spirit pines.

For what is beauty if not true,

To the self that once she knew?

___

In silent rooms, she tries to see,

A hint of who she used to be.

But shadows cast by every line,

Obscure the face fo the divine.

___

No knife can carve a heart's desire,

Nor shape the soul, or light the fire.

In plastic dreams, the truth is clear,

The self once known, now disappears.
