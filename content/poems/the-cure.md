*In shadows' grasp, where sunlight seldom gleams,*

*Two silent foes arise, as in a dream.*

*Depression, heavy anchor of the soul,*

*Anxiety, a tempest taking toll.*

___

*Depression, like a weight upon the chest,*

*A cloak of darkness, robbing all that's best.*

*It whispers lies, of hope forever lost,*

*As joy and peace it tirelessly exhausts.*

___

*Anxiety, a ceaseless, racing mind,*

*A storm that's hard to leave, impossible to bind.*

*It paints the future in uncertain hues,*

*With worry's brush, it weaves its web of blues.*

___

*But in this struggle, there is strength to find,*

*For deep within, the human spirit's kind.*

*We fight these battles, day by weary day,*

*Seeking the light to chase the dark away.*

___

*Support and love, our shields in this terrain,*

*Together we can weather all this pain.*

*For in the darkest night, a star will gleam,*

*And hope will rise, a beacon in the dream.*
