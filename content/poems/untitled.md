___

In the quiet of their rooms

they retreat

Silent echoes of a world

bittersweet

___

Parents counting grades

lost in the race

While children hide

seeking a safe space

___

Eyes on papers

numbers and scores

Missing whispers

behind closed doors

___

A's and B's

a relentless demand

Ignoring the plea

of a trembling hand

___

Dreams and hopes

weighed down by the scale

In the pursuit of a polished tale

Mental scars

___

unseen, profound

In a world where silence

makes no sound

When children speak

___

hearts in their eyes

Parents dismiss

with hurried replies

Their views unheede

___

seen as slight

In a home where love

should shine so bright

How absurd it is

___

this paradox

Chasing futures

while hearts turn to rocks

Wondering why shadows

___

seem so dense

In a home bereft

of true presence

Grades may shimmer

___

a fleeting light

But in those rooms

they battle night

Parents, pause

___

here the silent scream

For love, not marks

builds the dream

Listen close

___

to their silent plea

For in their eyes

true needs you'll see

A world through their lens

vast and real

Only then can wounds

> **truly heal**

___
