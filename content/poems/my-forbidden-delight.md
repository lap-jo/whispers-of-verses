___
You're like a cigarette,

I keep consuming 

Your toxic allure

In your smoke

I cannot be free

___

Each drag I take 

A fleeting pleasure 

Yet deeper into darkness 

> I descend 

Your burning touch 

A dangerous treasure 

Leaving scars 

That never truly mend 

___

Like wisps of smoke 

You drift away 

Leaving aches of longing in your wake 

I chase your ghost 

Day after day 

Knowing the toll 

Knowing the ache 

___

But still, I reach for you 

My forbidden delight 

In shadows where our secrets lie 

For in your embrace

I feel respite 

Even as I suffocate 

Even as I sigh
