I keep waiting for that fabled pause 

The quiet corner where I'll meet myself 

Yet I'm a stranger brushing by in a crowd 

Just an echo left unclaimed 

______

They say to find yourself is simple 

Like opening your eyes to morning light 

But here I'm a blur, a fading song 

The shadow cast by someone else's sun.

---

I hold all the night fragments 

A laugh here, a memory there 

The name I sign in practiced ink

But none of it fits, none of it stays
___

Life spills forward like a runaway train

And I sit in the passenger seat

Pretending I know the destination 

Knowing I can't even find the map
___

They say the journey shapes you whole 

But I'm scattered across miles of empty roads 

A constellation lost in daylight 

A voice caught in the wind's careless arms
___

Perhaps someday I'll meet myself 

Twos ships colliding in this endless blur

But for now, I'm just a half-finished story 

A name carved into water
