You hate the system 

Call it corrupt 

But who's the one that builds it up?

The leaders come from the public ground 

Your lies, your greed, the echo round 
___

You curse the government, blame the state 

But it's your actions that create 

The very rot you claim to see

The problem starts with you and me
___

So fix yourself before you cry 

"The country's doomed, the end is nigh."

A nation's health is in our hands 

We shape it's fate 

We set its plans
