Love did not come

as thunder or revelation—

it crept in

the moment your absence

became more tangible

than your voice.

___

You do not make me **le**vi**tate**—

**in**stead, you are the **wind** that blows

**be**neath my wings, and I—

a **but**terfly just **learn**ing how to **fly**.

I did not ask the stars for a sign,

I asked them to be silent,

so your breath could echo

across the cosmos of my ribs.

___

If I were the **moon**,

I would wait through an **e**clipse entire,

to feel the ghost of your **fin**ger

**pass**ing like flame on my **face**.

You are the **fuel**, and I the **fire**—

but you are not the **light** in my **dark**ness.

You are the **soul** that **lingered**,

who **sta**yed through the night

till the **sun** burned back through the **sky**.

___

My name has edges now

cut from the syllables of your silence.

And even silence

has started to sound like you.

___

Even the desert learned how to **blossom**

watching your shadow **fall** upon my **skin**.

___

Were I the author of the stars,

I would unwrite their fire

just to have you need **me**

in a world of **dark**.

But you—

you were born with a thousand names,

and I, with none,

except the one I earned

by **lov**ing you.
