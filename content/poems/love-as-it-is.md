I will not paint thee soft with golden phrase 

Nor dress thy flaws in satin metaphors 

Love is no angel born of heaven's haze 

But earth-bound flesh that aches, and tears,

 and roars. 

- - -

Thou art not flawless, neither am I whole.

We crash like waves, then sink beneath the tide 

Yet in thy storm, I find my anchor'd soul 

A place where rawest truths dos still abide.

- - -

Speak not of stars or roses in their bloom 

Love lies in shadows where we bare our scars 

It is the flame that feeds as a thousand stars.

- - -

No polished lie just this: I love you still 

And loving you 

I bend the world to will.
