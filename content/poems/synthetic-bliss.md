The night hums low, a neon sting,


Glass skies fracture as echoes sing.


I chase the numb in a velvet mist,


A counterfeit world clenched in my fist.

\---

**Soft fire burns, but I feel no heat,**


**The ground is gone beneath my feet.**


Unreal whispers in my ear,


Promise love without the fear.

Perfume laced with a chemical ache,


Eyes like smoke in the choices we make.


Her voice, a film of static haze,


Paints my mind in a thousand grays.

\---

**Touch me, but I’ll never feel,**


**Reality’s bite too sharp to heal.**


Laughter cracks like broken glass,

\---


This fleeting high will never last.

I’m drifting now, a phantom tide,

Caught in the pull where truths collide.


Her name dissolves like salt in rain,


I am lost, and she’s my Novacane.
