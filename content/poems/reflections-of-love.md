*In the mirror’s gaze, find strength untold,*

*Embrace the flaws, let self-love unfold.*

*A dance with echoes of kindness within,*

*Cherish the soul, let self-love begin.*

*Through trials and triumphs, be your guide,*

*In the heart’s cathedral, let love reside.*

*Each flaw a note in the melody of you,*

*Compose a symphony, authentic and true.*

*Like petals unfolding in morning light,*

*Discover self-love, a radiant sight.*

*No need for judgment, let acceptance bloom,*

*A garden of self-love, banish self-doubt’s gloom.*

*Celebrate the journey, the scars you wear,*

*A testament to resilience, proof that you care.*

*In the tapestry of self, each thread divine,*

*Love yourself wholly, let your light shine.*

*For in the vast cosmos of your being,*

*Find galaxies of love, endlessly freeing.*

*Embrace the canvas of your unique art,*

*A masterpiece of love, a work of the heart.*
