___

In the quiet of the night, beneath the moon's soft glow,

Even those of sterner mold can let their emotions flow.

For strength is not in silence, nor in walls built tall,

But in the willingness to feel, to rise after a fall.

___

They carry burdens heavy, hidden beneath their guise,

Yet within their hearts, the truth never truly dies.

For tears are not a weakness, but a testament to grace,

A reminder of their humanity in this tumultous race.

___

So let the tears fall freely, let them cleanse the soul,

For even those of firm resolve can make themselves whole.

In vulnerability lies courage, in tears, a song,

For they, too are human, imperfect, yet strong.
